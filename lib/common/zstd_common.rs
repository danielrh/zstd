/* *<
Let's now decompose FSE_decompress_usingDTable() into its unitary components.
You will decode FSE-encoded symbols from the bitStream,
and also any other bitFields you put in, **in reverse order**.

You will need a few variables to track your bitStream. They are :

BIT_DStream_t DStream;    // Stream context
FSE_DState_t  DState;     // State context. Multiple ones are possible
FSE_DTable*   DTablePtr;  // Decoding table, provided by FSE_buildDTable()

The first thing to do is to init the bitStream.
    errorCode = BIT_initDStream(&DStream, srcBuffer, srcSize);

You should then retrieve your initial state(s)
(in reverse flushing order if you have several ones) :
    errorCode = FSE_initDState(&DState, &DStream, DTablePtr);

You can then decode your data, symbol after symbol.
For information the maximum number of bits read by FSE_decodeSymbol() is 'tableLog'.
Keep in mind that symbols are decoded in reverse order, like a LIFO stack (last in, first out).
    unsigned char symbol = FSE_decodeSymbol(&DState, &DStream);

You can retrieve any bitfield you eventually stored into the bitStream (in reverse order)
Note : maximum allowed nbBits is 25, for 32-bits compatibility
    size_t bitField = BIT_readBits(&DStream, nbBits);

All above operations only read from local register (which size depends on size_t).
Refueling the register from memory is manually performed by the reload method.
    endSignal = FSE_reloadDStream(&DStream);

BIT_reloadDStream() result tells if there is still some more data to read from DStream.
BIT_DStream_unfinished : there is still some data left into the DStream.
BIT_DStream_endOfBuffer : Dstream reached end of buffer. Its container may no longer be completely filled.
BIT_DStream_completed : Dstream reached its exact end, corresponding in general to decompression completed.
BIT_DStream_tooFar : Dstream went too far. Decompression result is corrupted.

When reaching end of buffer (BIT_DStream_endOfBuffer), progress slowly, notably if you decode multiple symbols per loop,
to properly detect the exact end of stream.
After each decoded symbol, check if DStream is fully consumed using this simple test :
    BIT_reloadDStream(&DStream) >= BIT_DStream_completed

When it's done, verify decompression is fully completed, by checking both DStream and the relevant states.
Checking if DStream has reached its end is performed by :
    BIT_endOfDStream(&DStream);
Check also the states. There might be some symbols left there, if some high probability ones (>50%) are possible.
    FSE_endOfDState(&DState);
